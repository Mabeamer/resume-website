#TODO
-ytdl functionality
-I want the page to take the Title, thumbnail, Time, file. (Does tihs information need to be laid in json)
-Download options (webm, mp3, mp4)


Current Issue-
Need to have validation to see if the link is validation
    -Youtube
    -Soundcloud
  #Does this need to be focused on right now or can I focus on validation after the functionality works?


#Unsure if I am debugging properly using print statements.
#checked: Printing to the console
#I do not know if information from main.py is being sent to ytdl.py.
#checked: Now sending information through files. 

#SIDENOTES
main.py-
There is a need to check for a POST method to send information to a server, after that `request.form` to grab 
the textbox information and store it inside of a python function.

It takes a second to recieve hte information, maybe consider a timer for the end user?

webdl.py-
When link is grabbed there needs to be a check based off of the streams, the user can pick.
I would be able to pick based off the 'itag'. Display a list of all the itags that fall under the desired choice
(360p, 720p ect.)
Then return the object/download to main(?)
